# Narcissistic Numbers
> A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).
> For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:
> ```1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153```
